//! Circuit Breaker pattern implementation.
//!
//! The *circuit breaker pattern* is a design pattern for building resilient systems
//! by preventing repeated failure requests to a service or operation that is likely to fail.
//! It improves system reliability, reduces strain on failing components, and helps ensure
//! that the system remains responsive even when part of it is in a degraded state.
//!
//! ### Motivation
//!
//! In distributed systems, it's common for one part of the system to fail, causing ripple
//! effects that result in even more failures (often referred to as *cascading failures*).
//! When one service is overloaded or malfunctioning, continuous attempts to access it can
//! make things worse by further overwhelming the service and other dependent services.
//!
//! The Circuit Breaker pattern helps mitigate this issue by "tripping" a breaker when a
//! service starts failing frequently, stopping further calls to the service until it has
//! had time to recover. This helps prevent unnecessary load on already failing components
//! and gives them a chance to recover without being constantly bombarded with requests.
//!
//! ### Automatic Recovery After Timeout
//!
//! One of the features of the circuit breaker pattern is *automatic recovery*. After
//! the breaker trips and enters the [`states::Open`] state due to a series of failures, it will stay
//! in that state for a pre-configured timeout period. Once the timeout elapses, the circuit
//! breaker will automatically transition to the [`states::HalfOpen`] state.
//!
//! In the [`states::HalfOpen`] state, the system attempts to make a small number of requests to see
//! if the underlying service has recovered. If the service responds successfully, the breaker
//! will transition back to the [`states::Closed`] state, and normal operations resume. If failures persist,
//! the breaker will revert to the [`states::Open`] state, and the recovery process starts again after
//! another timeout.
//!
//! This mechanism allows the system to "self-heal" without manual intervention, automatically
//! testing the service's availability after a failure period, and recovering once the service
//! is deemed stable again.
//!
//! ### Example Usage
//!
//! See [`FaultyRoute`] for an example of integrating the circuit breaker
//! in a web service scenario. This example demonstrates how the circuit breaker
//! can be used to prevent repeatedly calling a service that is in a failing state.
//!
//! ### Further Reading
//!
//! Based on [Martin Fowlerâ€™s blog post on Circuit Breakers](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html).
